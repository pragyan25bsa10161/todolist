# 📝 Simple Python To-Do List Application

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a basic, menu-driven **To-Do List application** built entirely in **Python**. It's designed to run in the command-line interface (CLI) and uses a fundamental Python list (`tasks`) to store all the user's tasks. This assignment demonstrates core programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditional logic, and list manipulation.

---

## ✨ Features

The application provides the following four main functionalities:

* **View Tasks:** Display all current to-do items with their corresponding list number.
* **Add Task:** Prompt the user for a new task description and append it to the list.
* **Delete Task:** Allow the user to remove a task by entering its list number. Includes robust **input validation** to prevent errors.
* **Exit:** Terminates the application gracefully.

## ⚙️ Installation & Running the Project

Since this is a single, self-contained Python script, installation is minimal.

### Prerequisites

You must have **Python 3** installed on your machine.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository (If applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```

2.  **Save the Code:**
    Ensure the provided code is saved in a file named `todo_app.py` (or any `.py` extension).

3.  **Run the Application:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the file is saved, and execute the script using the Python interpreter:
    ```bash
    python todo_app.py
    ```

The application menu will then appear, allowing you to interact with the To-Do list.
